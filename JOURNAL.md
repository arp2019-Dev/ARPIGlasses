# MAY 23rd: Started the major research for some optics

I looked at how many expensive smart glasses work, and most use a micro OLED display with some optics to move the image down and into your eyes. This, however, looks bulky and is not nice to use according to users. This is our challenge when it comes to smart glasses since it's hard to get a high-res image to focus at such a close distance to your eyes. Many use prisms and beam splitters to combine the 2 sources of light (1 is the display and the other is the world).

Great exmaple of a optics system is the google glass explorer which uses a beam splitter and mirror to focus the light.
