# MAY 23rd: Started the major research for some optics

I looked at how many expensive smart glasses work, and most use a micro OLED display with some optics to move the image down and into your eyes. This, however, looks bulky and is not nice to use according to users. This is our challenge when it comes to smart glasses since it's hard to get a high-res image to focus at such a close distance to your eyes. Many use prisms and beam splitters to combine the 2 sources of light (1 is the display and the other is the world).

A great example of an optics system is the Google Glass Explorer, which uses a beam splitter and mirror to focus the light.

# MAY 24th: More research on the optics for some types of glasses

So, I spent some time looking at more glasses and methods for projecting the image. I initially thought I could put the display far back on the side of the head and then use a bunch of mirrors to "move" the image, but after a lot of calculations, I realized it wouldn't work unless the size was big. Instead, I will just need to stick with the beam splitter and a  combo of lenses to focus the image closer.

Unfortunately, idk where my paper with some of my calculations went since I just did some while researching. If I find it, ill place it here.

# MAY 25th: Did some display research

So turns out there is this really cool display tech that projects the image directly into your retina using low-power lasers. Super intriguing and I was gonna use it, but 1. super expensive and hard to find. 2. Safety, you need hella precision to not wreck your eyes.
I also found a nice simulator that allows me to test different lenses and custom optics. To get this, I put together a quick prism and beam splitter.
